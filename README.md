Scraping Pitchwork's best albums list and linking up magnet links

This was kind of a "see if I can" kind of thing.

Turns out I could!

I first had this idea in 2011, right before I started I started my first business. I originally wanted to scrape the internet for Mediafire links, Rapidshare etc. but I didn't have much technical know-how in those days. Torrents have become much more user-friendly since then, hence why I scrapped the link thing.

Fun fact: In 2011, I spent 3 weeks fruitlessly putting together a Wordpress site... I wrote this entirely in 3 days.

# running the scraper
    npm install
    cd ./node-stuff
    node get.js

# WARNING

Depending on where you live, this might be illegal. I live in the United Kingdom, and so I haven't used this to download anything. It is just a proof of concept that I built.

# help

If you know any review sites similar to Pitchfork that critique free-to-share music albums, I would be extremely interested in hooking that up.
